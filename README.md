## Getting Started
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your development environment:

1. **Python**: You'll need Python installed. You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **NodeJS**

## Installation

## Running the Server:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the GlucoWise repository from GitHub to your local machine. This step ensures you have the server's source code.
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/athmika26/GlucoWise
    ```
    
2. **Change the directory to backend**: Open the backend folder.
     ```bash
      cd backend
    ```
     
3. **Install all the modules**:
    While in cloned directory, run
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Install Python packages if prompted**
   
5. **Start the Server**: Launch the server with the given command. This action starts the server locally, and it will be accessible at the specified address (here `http://localhost:3000/`).

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## Running the Website:

1. **Change the directory to frontend**: Open the frontend folder.
    ```bash
      cd frontend
    ```
2. **Run the website**:
    ```bash
      npm run dev
    ```

These steps will help you set up and run both the server and the website smoothly. You're now ready to go!
The server will be hosted on `http://localhost:5173`.
